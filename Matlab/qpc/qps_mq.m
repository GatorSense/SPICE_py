%  This branch-and-bound type algorithm attempts to solve
%  quadratic programming problems in the following form:
%
%   x* = arg min   0.5x'Hx + f'x
%             x
%
%            s.t.  l  <= x <= u,   bound constraints.
%
%  In Matlab a call to this function would look like:
%
%    [x,err,lm] = qps_mq(H,f,l,u);
%
%  where the inputs are:
%
%        H: An (n x n) positive semi-definite symmetric matrix
%
%	     f: A n element column vector
%	
%        l: Element-wise lower bound constraints
%
%        u: Element-wise upper bound constraints
%
%  and the outputs are:
%
%              x: the optimal solution (if obtained)
%
%            err: error number, if err=0, then x is optimal
%
%             lm: structure of Lagrange multipliers 
% 
%  lm.lowerbound: Lagrange multipliers for lower bound constraints
%
%  lm.upperbound: Lagrange multipliers for upper bound constraints
%
% NOTE: Both l and u must be provided, however, +/-inf entries are
%       acceptable so that "free" variables are catered for.
