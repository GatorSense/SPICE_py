To get the software working, proceed as follows:1. Once unzipped (you have probably done this bit already :o)) the   archive should contain the following files: ./qpas.m./qpas.mexmaci./qpas.mexw32./qpas.mexglx./qpas.mexa64./qpip.m./qpip.mexmaci./qpip.mexw32./qpip.mexglx./qpip.mexa64./qps_as.m./qps_as.mexmaci./qps_as.mexw32./qps_as.mexglx./qps_as.mexa64./qps_ip.mexmaci./qps_ip.mexw32./qps_ip.mexglx./qps_ip.mexa64./qps_mq.m./qps_mq.mexmaci./qps_mq.mexw32./qps_mq.mexglx./qps_mq.mexa64./qpgen.m./test.m./README./LICENSE2. Move these files to a directory of your choice.3. Start Matlab and change to the directory you used in step 2. 4. Try running the test.m script. That's it!Please email any questions/comments/criticisms to:  Adrian.Wills@newcastle.edu.au
