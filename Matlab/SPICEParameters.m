function [parameters] = SPICEParameters()

%   This function sets the parameters to be used during the SPICE algorithm
%   parameters - struct - The struct contains the following fields:
%                   1. u : Regularization Parameter to trade off between the RSS and V terms
%                   2. gamma: Gamma Constant for SPT term, Controls degree
%                       of sparsity among endmembers
%                   3. changeThresh: Stopping Criteria, Change threshold
%                       for Objective Function.
%                   4. M: Initial Number of endmembers
%                   5. iterationCap: Maximum number of iterations
%                   6. endmemberPruneThreshold: Proportion threshold used
%                       to prune endmembers
%                   7. produceDisplay : Set to 1 if a progress display is
%                       wanted
%                   9. initEM: Set to nan to randomly select endmembers,
%                       otherwise NxM matrix of M endmembers with N spectral
%                       bands, Number of endmembers must equal parameters.M
